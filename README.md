## But.. how it works?

* The extension has two important files: `inject.js` and `theme.css`.
* `inject.js` is a script that inject itself inside Tidal, it will then load `theme.css` and do another little things that aren't possible when only using CSS.
* `theme.css` is the file that will modify the look of Tidal interface.


## But.. how install?

This extension does not figure in the Chrome Web Store, so you need to install it manually:
* Go to chrome://extensions and enable the developer mode.
* Download the last release.zip of the [extension](https://github.com/johan-perso/comfy-for-tidal/releases) on your device and decompress it.
* On Chrome, click on "Load unpacked extension" and choose the folder where you extracted the extension files.

That's it, the extension should be installed!
